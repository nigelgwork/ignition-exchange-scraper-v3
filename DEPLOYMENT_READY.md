## 📊 Commit Summary

**Commit Hash**: `761bbeb`
**Message**: "feat: Complete v3 infrastructure with FastAPI scraper service, Ignition scripts, and comprehensive documentation"

### Major Components in This Commit

1. **Scraper Service**
   - REST API with 10 endpoints
   - Playwright browser automation
   - PostgreSQL integration
   - Real-time progress tracking

2. **Database Schema**
   - 5 tables with 11 indexes
   - 5 views for data access
   - 2 utility functions

3. **Ignition Scripts**
   - API client (exchangeScraperAPI.py)
   - Notifications (exchangeScraperNotifications.py)
   - Scheduler (exchangeScraperScheduler.py)

4. **Documentation**
   - Setup guide (7 parts)
   - Dashboard design (complete specs)
   - Troubleshooting (11 issues)
   - Project status (comprehensive)

5. **Docker Environment**
   - PostgreSQL 16
   - Ignition Gateway latest
   - Scraper service with health checks

## ⚠️ Known Issue (Documented)

**Browser Launch Incompatibility**:
- Standalone Playwright script: ✅ Works perfectly
- FastAPI + Playwright: ❌ Hangs indefinitely
- Root cause: `sync_playwright()` incompatibility with FastAPI/Uvicorn in WSL2
- **Tomorrow's fix**: Refactor to subprocess CLI tool (Option A in PROJECT_STATUS.md)

All troubleshooting steps and findings documented in:
- `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (section: "Latest Troubleshooting")
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (Issue #1)

## 📝 For Tomorrow Morning

### Priority 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd /git/ignition-exchange-scraper-v3
git push -u origin master
```

### Priority 2: Fix Browser Launch
Three options documented in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`:

**Option A (Recommended)**: Refactor scraper as standalone CLI tool
- Create `scraper-service/cli.py` that runs independently
- Modify `api.py` to call CLI via subprocess
- Proven approach that will work

**Option B**: Try Playwright's async API
- Replace `sync_playwright()` with `async with async_playwright()`
- May resolve eventloop conflicts

**Option C**: Deep-dive eventloop investigation
- Check FastAPI/Uvicorn eventloop
- Investigate Playwright's internal mechanisms

### Priority 3: Test Full Scrape
Once browser launches:
1. Run full scrape (15-20 minutes)
2. Verify 400+ resources in database
3. Test all API endpoints
4. Proceed with Ignition setup

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Infrastructure**: 100% Complete ✅
- FastAPI service
- Database schema
- Docker environment
- Gateway scripts
- Documentation

**Testing**: 50% Complete ⏳
- API endpoints: ✅ Tested
- Database: ✅ Tested
- Standalone browser: ✅ Works
- Integrated scrape: ❌ Browser won't launch

**Deployment**: 0% Complete 🔜
- Perspective dashboard: Not built yet (11 hours estimated)
- Ignition setup: Not started yet
- Production testing: Pending browser fix

## 💡 Key Insights from Tonight

1. **WSL2 Compatibility**: Running in WSL2 environment requires special browser flags
2. **FastAPI + Playwright**: Incompatibility discovered between sync_playwright() and FastAPI runtime
3. **Standalone Works**: Browser automation works perfectly outside FastAPI context
4. **Database Ready**: All schema, views, and functions tested and operational
5. **Documentation Complete**: Every aspect documented for handoff

## 🙏 Cleanup Done

Removed temporary files:
- ✅ `test_browser.py` deleted
- ✅ Venv directory excluded in .gitignore
- ✅ All test jobs remain in database for reference (Jobs #1-#8)
